//notes

#source mean that the source of data come from of file named adfecgdb/r01.edf
in the group of data "adfecgdb", the record started on january 1 
at 00:00:00.018

#there are 6 different signals in the files and each signal have 60,000
samples 

#the frecuency of the sample is about 1000 Hz, it means that it takes one 
sample of each 0.001 second

# Rows (Signal,Gain,Base Units)
Direct_1 is the first signal with a gain of 9.99984741211 and It is measured
with Uv
